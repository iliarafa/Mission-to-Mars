# Mission-to-Mars

##  * this is a  web-scraping project. 

The objective of this project is to build a web application that scrapes data related to planet Mars and displays news, facts and images of each of the red planet's hemispheres in an HTML page. 

The script is designed to scrape the most recent data; each time we run the script, we pull the newest data available. As long as the source continues to be updated we will have a constant influx of new information.

*We used Splinter to automate the web browser, BeautifulSoup to parse and extract the data, and MongoDB to hold the data that has been gathered*
